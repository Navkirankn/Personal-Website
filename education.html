        <p>brief information about me</p>

                <h3>High School</h3>
                <p> In high school I did Cross Country and Track (was not very good but it was great for getting in shape). It was the Most torturous
                    yet best experience of my life. It was total torture sometimes when we would have to do long runs but it was all worth it in the end.
                    I also was part of the International Bachelorette (IB) program at Modesto High, unfortunately due to moving I had to leave that incomplete
                    My high school experience unlike many was the best time in my entire life. I made a lot of friends with people who actually matched my humor
                    and energy.
                </p>

            <div class="edcol">
                <h3>College</h3>
                <p> I came to Washington and was informed about running start. A program to be able to get your HS diploma and Associates at the same time. I
                    immediately accepted because I was a pretty smart student and could handle it. I had one and a half quarters there and then Covid hit. We 
                    moved online and that was it for college, just finished the rest online. The highlight was getting awarded the global seal of biliteracy
                    in spanish, out of many who took the test only a select amount passed, I was honored to be certified bilingual in spanish.
                </p>

            <div class="edcol">
                <h3>University</h3>
                <p> My acceptance into UW was the highlight of my life. I always wanted to go here even when I lived in California, seeing this dream become a
                    reality was a feeling you can't describe. Being able to see in person the images I once saw online was a true feeling of accomplishment. UW 
                    was back in person for my first quarter there, I was able to actually experience college life (limitedly of course-due to covid) but it has
                    been great so far and I hope my remaining year and a half here is even better.
