                <h2>Imposter Syndrome in CS</h2>
                <p>I write blogs about two different topics, one is about my struggles as a cs student. I know a lot
                    of student suffer from imposter syndrome and many others about where life will take them. I think of
                    these blogs as a stress reliever and a way to dump my emotions and how I solved some of those problems.
                    Along with more basic things like school life, applying to college and many other topics high school and
                    college students may struggle with
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Another topic of my blog is minature guides to basic data structures. Simple functions and guides to help me
                    and whoever else remember datastructures and topics related to cs. A blog is the perfect way to not only dispense
                    information but also teach and reteach myself some of the things I may have forgotten. Occasionally when I have the
                    time I will dive into topics I havent learned yet and try to expand my cs knowledge as cs is a field where you can never
                    stop learning.
                </p>
                <h2>Projects I have done</h2>
                <p> I began to code this website as a way to teach myself html and css while also creating a personalized portfolio for me.
                    This quickly became one of the coding projects I am most proud of. Jumping into a new language and going for something this
                    complex is not something advised but I wanted a challenge. One of the main issues was finding the right place to code, once 
                    finding that since html was a new language I needed help on formatting texts getting the images loaded and many more issues.
                    Formatting was the biggest issue in this project and I feel like I learned a lot from this project on formatting. Another reason
                    why I loved making this webiste was because I got to learn some cool functions of html and CSS they are very cool languages and I 
                    now want to use them more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A project I had so much issues in was a GUI animal fight simulation (code is on github). This project introduced GUI's which are extremely
                    difficult to master. Figuring out the GUI's buttons and making the functions do the correct things at the buttons was a struggle. I think the
                    biggest issue was a bug I encounteree while coding that would make the GUI load blank. I had to look into it for hours until I finally realized
                    the issue was with a simple setvisual function error.
