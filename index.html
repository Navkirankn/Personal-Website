        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p> Both of my Parents are Punjabi. I love being Indian because we have the best food (shahi paneer and garlic naan = the BEST combo), 
                    best parties(entire week long weddings) and best outfits. I love Indian attire and getting dressed up in lenghas and Punjabi suits 
                    makes me feel so royal and elegant. I have taken classes to play the harmonium one of the religious instruments in our culture.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>School life</h3>
                <p> While in School I always had an interest towards math. It was my favorite subject since I scored a perfect score on the math portion
                    of the state test back in 3rd grade (we had a whole award ceremony and everything!). My math teachers have always been my favorite
                    and I would race with my friends to solve assigments the quickest. Since I had this interest I chose to go into engineering in the
                    hopes that I would be able to expand my knowledge.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p> I love to write music. I have like 30 songs written and more in the way. I find it to be a time killer and an easy way to come up with
                    random stories in my head. I also love to listen to music some of my favorite artists are Ariana Grande and Charlie Puth. Another hobby
                    is playing badmittion, although I never played professionally it has always been a major hobby and in my family I am the reigning champion.
